    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The hoagie may seem too simple to be called a recipe, but 
            there are many little things that can turn a passable sandwich 
            into a <em>truly palatable</em> one! Why do you think the deli's 
            sandwiches taste so much better than the ones you make
            at home? With the right tricks, those mouth-watering deli 
            sandwiches can become a convenient part of your daily arsenal! </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Baguette</li>
            <li>Several sandwich meats of choice (e.g. Salami, pepperoni, turkey)</li>
            <li>Cheese of choice (e.g. pepperjack)</li>
            <li>Iceberg lettuce</li>
            <li>Sliced tomato (optional)</li>
            <li>Honey Mustard</li>
            <li>Vinegar (e.g. white vinegar)</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Salt (optional)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the baguette open</li>
            <li>Add honey mustard to bottom and top halves of baguette.</li>
            <li>Add vingear to bottom and top halves of baguette.</li>
            <li>(Optional) If you like, mix some vigar with olive oil in a seperate bowl to
                make a vinegarette. Then, you can mix some salt into that vinegarette
                and apply that to your sandwich in place of vinegar.
            </li> 
            <li>Add meat slices onto bottom half of baguette.</li>
            <li>Salt meat slices (lightly).</li>
            <li>Add cheese on top of meat slices. (The sticky cheese is the bond
                between the "meat layer" with the "vegetable layer.")</li>
            <li>Add tomato slices (optional).</li>
            <li>Add iceberg lettuce.</li>
            <li>Close baguette firmly.</li>
            <li><strong>DONE!</strong> Now, you can pop your baguette in the toaster for extra crispiness,
                wrap it in wax paper to let the flavors/juices squeeze in more, 
                or just eat it right now! </li>
        </ol>
